## Welcome to PasifikaOS

## Getting Started: Coming Soon

PasifikaOS Web3 is currently in active development and will be available for download towards the end of July 2025. This gives Pacific communities time to prepare for testing and deployment while we finalize the integration of all blockchain components and complete extensive security testing.

Whether you're a government administrator looking to reduce software costs, an educator seeking to empower students with digital literacy, or a community leader interested in exploring Web3 technologies, PasifikaOS will provide the foundation for digital sovereignty in the Pacific.

The future belongs to communities that control their own digital destiny. Europe is leading the way, and the Pacific can follow with PasifikaOS as our vessel for this crucial journey.

## About PasifikaOS 

PasifikaOS is a lightweight, energy-efficient and secure variant based Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 LTS tailored to provide an elegant, user-friendly computing experience. But more importantly, it empowers users with the freedom and security of an open-source operating system, free from the constraints and risks of pirated proprietary software.

PasifikaOS comes loaded with Bitcoin Core with the vision of welcoming citizens to the domain of Web3 as an enabler in getting them familiar with blockchains with Bitcoin as the first and primer for other cryptocurrencies.

Additionally, PasifikaOS also includes educational resources about Bitcoin, blockchain technology, and the importance of financial literacy, freedom and security in the digital age. Our goal is not just to provide tools, but to empower our community with knowledge.

Moreover, FBI published a report on the state of crypto-related fraud. According to the report, crypto-related losses exceeded $5.6B in 2023 (a 45% increase) which is half of total reported financial fraud losses processed by the agency. PasifikaOS prioritizes security by making it easier than ever for citizens to host their own Bitcoin nodes to confirm transactions and running PasifikaOS from a USB flash drive as their own personal secure hardware wallet.

## History

PasifikaOS 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 community-driven Linux distributions were based on Lubuntu variant of Ubuntu using LXDE, the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment. 

Despite my best efforts from 2019 to 2024, the PasifikaOS project failed to gain significant traction and adoption across the islands. I realized that while the intentions were noble, the execution fell short of truly empowering local communities with the right tools and resources.
