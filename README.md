## About PasifikaOS 

PasifikaOS is based on the lightweight and energy-efficient Lubuntu variant of Ubuntu, tailored to provide an elegant, user-friendly computing experience. But more importantly, it empowers users with the freedom and security of an open-source operating system, free from the constraints and risks of pirated proprietary software.

## History

Despite my best efforts from May 2019 to April 2020, the PasifikaOS project failed to gain significant traction and adoption across the islands. I realized that while the intentions were noble, the execution fell short of truly empowering local communities with the right tools and resources.

* 2019 - [PasifikaOS 0.0.1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BjPci7oPANdDT8ospCLiohrPbctCarCB/view?usp=sharing) - My first release of PasifikaOS.

* 2024 - [PasifikaOS 0.0.3](https://img.freepik.com/premium-vector/welcome-web-30-abstract-future-hud-geometric-shape-design_48644-306.jpg?w=740) - My third release of PasifikaO is coming soon!

## The Revival

Undeterred, I have decided to rededicate my retirement to the revial of PasifikaOS.

This time, PasifikaOS will be the manifestation of my whitepaper [Decentralized Micro-Governance Model for the Kingdom of Tonga Based on Proof-of-Work Consensus](https://github.com/EdwinLiavaa/Whitepaper) in the form of an open-source Operating System project.

## The Future

In order to achieve this vision, I have to give all citizens PasifikaOS as the tool to engage with the world in [Proof-of-Work as Humanity's Emancipation Engine](https://github.com/EdwinLiavaa/liavaa.space/blob/main/blog/20240602/20240602.md)
