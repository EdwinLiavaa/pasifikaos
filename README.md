## Welcome to PasifikaOS

Your Bitcoin Core Operating System

## About PasifikaOS 

PasifikaOS is a lightweight, energy-efficient and secure variant based Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 LTS: Noble Numbat with Linux Kernel 6.8.0-36-generic (x86_64), tailored to provide an elegant, user-friendly computing experience. But more importantly, it empowers users with the freedom and security of an open-source operating system, free from the constraints and risks of pirated proprietary software.

PasifikaOS comes loaded with Bitcoin Core with the vision of welcoming citizens to the domain of Web3 as an enabler in getting them familiar with blockchains with Bitcoin as the first and primer for other cryptocurrencies.

Additionally, PasifikaOS also includes educational resources about Bitcoin, blockchain technology, and the importance of financial literacy, freedom and security in the digital age. Our goal is not just to provide tools, but to empower our community with knowledge.

Moreover, FBI published a report on the state of crypto-related fraud. According to the report, crypto-related losses exceeded $5.6B in 2023 (a 45% increase) which is half of total reported financial fraud losses processed by the agency. PasifikaOS priortises security by making it easier than ever for citizens to host their own Bitcoin nodes to confirm transactions and running PasifikaOS from a USB flash drive as their own personal secure hardware wallet.

## History

PasifikaOS 1.0 and 2.0 community-driven Linux distribution were based on Lubuntu variant of Ubuntu using LXDE, the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment. 

Despite my best efforts from May 2019 to April 2020, the PasifikaOS project failed to gain significant traction and adoption across the islands. I realized that while the intentions were noble, the execution fell short of truly empowering local communities with the right tools and resources.

## Current Developments

We are giving all citizens PasifikaOS as the tool to engage with the world in [Proof-of-Work as Humanity's Emancipation Engine](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-proof-of-work-as-humanitys-emancipation-engine)

* Looking Ahead

The integration of Bitcoin Core into PasifikaOS is just the beginning. As we continue to develop our decentralized micro-governance model, we're exploring ways to leverage Bitcoin's blockchain for secure, transparent voting mechanisms and policy implementation.

* Expanding Our Blockchain Ecosystem: Rootstock node Integration

With my commitment to creating a robust and versatile blockchain ecosystem within PasifikaOS, I'm excited to announce that I am also planning to integrate PasifikaOS as a Rootstock Node, parallel to the Bitcoin Core implementation.

Rootstock is the Smart Contract platform of Bitcoin. Its engine is a forked version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), and the RVM (Rootstock Virtual Machine) is compatible with Ethereum Smart Contracts and the tools used to deploy and interact with them.

1. Turing-Complete Smart Contracts: The RSK Virtual Machine (RVM) provides a Turing-complete environment for smart contract execution. This allows you to implement more complex decentralized applications (dApps) on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.

2. Ethereum Compatibility: RSK is highly compatible with Ethereum's ecosystem, including compilers, tools, and dApps. This means you can leverage the existing Ethereum development ecosystem and port your dApps to run on the RSK platform.

3. Improved Transaction Experience: RSK provides faster transaction confirmations (around 30 seconds on average) compared to the Bitcoin blockchain. This can improve the user experience for your dApps that require more immediate transaction processing.

4. Merged Mining with Bitcoin: RSK is secured by the same proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, using the SHA-256 algorithm. This means RSK benefits from the high hashrate and security of the Bitcoin mining network.

5. Two-Way Peg with Bitcoin: RSK utilizes a two-way peg mechanism to allow users to transfer Bitcoins in and out of the RSK blockchain, creating "Smart Bitcoins" (RBTC) that can be used within the RSK ecosystem.

6. Potential to Expand Bitcoin's Use Cases: By providing a Turing-complete smart contract platform on top of Bitcoin, RSK can enable new use cases and applications that were previously not possible on the Bitcoin blockchain alone.

7. Alignment with Bitcoin Ecosystem: The RSK whitepaper highlights the goal of aligning with the interests of key Bitcoin stakeholders, such as miners and users. This could be beneficial for your project if you wish to closely integrate with the Bitcoin ecosystem.

* Expanding Our Blockchain Ecosystem: Chainlink Integration

With my commitment to creating a robust and versatile blockchain ecosystem within PasifikaOS, I'm excited to announce that I am also planning to integrate PasifikaOS as a Chainlink Node, parallel to Rootstock and Bitcoin Core implementation.

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts on various blockchain platforms to securely access off-chain data feeds, web APIs, and traditional bank payments. By incorporating Chainlink node functionality into PasifikaOS, I aim to:

1. Enhance interoperability: Allow PasifikaOS users to interact with multiple blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps) across different platforms.

2. Enable data-driven governance: Leverage Chainlink's oracle capabilities to feed real-world data into our governance model, enabling more informed and responsive policy-making.

3. Foster innovation: Provide developers in our community with the tools to create advanced smart contracts and dApps that can interact with external data and systems.

4. Create economic opportunities: Allow PasifikaOS users to participate in the Chainlink network as node operators, potentially earning LINK tokens for providing reliable oracle services.

This triple integration of Bitcoin Core, Rootstock and Chainlink represents the holistic approach to blockchain adoption. While Bitcoin Core offers financial sovereignty and a robust store of value, Rootstock and Chainlink provides the critical data infrastructure needed for more complex blockchain applications and services.

I know that the combination of open-source software, blockchain technology, and grassroots participation will pave the way for a more equitable, transparent, and prosperous future. By embracing both Bitcoin, Rootstock and Chainlink, I am positioning PasifikaOS at the forefront of the decentralized revolution.

I invite all tech enthusiasts, blockchain advocates, and those passionate about digital sovereignty to join me in this exciting journey. Whether you're interested in testing PasifikaOS 3.0, contributing to its development, or simply learning more about the vision, your participation is welcome.

The road to financial freedom is paved with open-source code and decentralized networks. With Bitcoin Core, Rootstock, Chainlink, and PasifikaOS, we're taking giant leaps forward. More innovations are on the horizon â€“ this is just the beginning of our journey towards true digital and financial sovereignty.
